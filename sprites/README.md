## Credit

The sprites in `orig/` and `tools/pkmncompress.c` are from [pret/pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered). The sprites under the `new/` folder were modeled after a [post](https://www.deviantart.com/ghost-missingno/art/Blue-Sprites-for-R-G-B-Y-339796334) on DeviantArt and recreated in GIMP by myself.
